            My Name is Ezeaku Onyekachi, I was born on the 12th of September to Mr

            I schooled in Ebonyi state and graduated as an Electrical Engineer in
            2023. I am currntly enrolled as a student in ALT School Africa and my

          <h2>My ALTSchool Africa Membership</h2>
          <p>
            My ALTSchool Africa membership is barely two months old, but I am very
            excited to see what it brings for me. I am currently enrolled in the
            School of Engineering and intend to major in Frontend Engineering, my
            ALTSchool ID is ALT/SOE/024/1008. I joined ALTSchool Africa because I
            have been a tech enthusiast for a while, but haven't had the
            opprtunity to learn from a top professional who could offer me a
            possiblity to get accountability partners; ALTSchool seemed to offer
            me that, coupled with the fact that ALTSchool was gracious enough to
            grant me a partial schorlaship which I am eternally grateful for; the
            thought of having a subsidized learning always pushes me not to relent
            whenever I feel down. I intend to see this course to the end and when
            I become a certified frontend web developer I want to use my skills to
            help the SME's around me to gain an online presence, and also use my
            skills to earn and be able to take care of my family and also inspire
            more young people that tech can be an alternative to criminal
            activities.
